The current strategic direction is shaped by a blend of past learnings and new mentorship, focusing on scalable growth, innovative sales, and market expansion.

**1. Strategic Foundation & Mentorship:**
*   **Lessons from Thomas:** Applied strategic partnership models, including client sharing, bundled service discounts, and leveraging psychological principles like the "sunken cost fallacy" to incentivize engagement.
*   **Groenlandia's Mentorship:** A new mentor, a successful ex-Google product developer, validates the vision for a lean, high-impact digital product company focused on autonomy and scalability. He actively supports outsourcing and efficient execution.

**2. Core Initiatives & Action Items:**
*   **Strategic Partnerships:** Actively pursuing partnerships with new connections, leveraging the learned models to create mutually beneficial client-sharing agreements.
*   **Mass Outreach Automation:** Finalizing a script for a major outreach initiative. The immediate action is to secure proxy access to enable mass deployment (scaling from 10-15 tests to hundreds of thousands) while protecting IP reputation.
*   **AI Sales & Branding (Medellín):** Targeting AI agencies in Medellín's "software valley" that may lack deep expertise. The strategy involves:
    *   **Projecting Professionalism:** Maintaining a polished image (e.g., high-end electronics, professional attire).
    *   **Networking:** Engaging in high-profile co-working spaces and meetings to build a "culture" around the product and generate leads.
    *   **Social & Sales Practice:** Utilizing every presentation opportunity to refine social skills and directly pitch services.
*   **"Ghost Job" Sales Tactic:** Leveraging companies that post "ghost jobs" (for data collection or market signaling) by applying for positions. The goal is to reach hiring managers during early-stage interviews and subtly pitch the product, effectively turning job interviews into direct sales opportunities while also building a personal job pipeline.

**3. Market Focus & Personal Drive:**
*   **Personal Drive:** A strong internal drive to prove capabilities and apply accumulated knowledge.
*   **Solar Energy Vertical:** Identified the US solar energy market as a key expansion area, driven by rising energy costs and government incentives. Initial outreach to solar companies has begun, informing a more refined approach to product-market fit.

These initiatives are designed for efficiency, strategic market penetration, and scalable growth, underpinned by continuous learning and a proactive approach to sales and partnerships.
