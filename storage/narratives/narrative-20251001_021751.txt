**Top 3 Accomplishments:**

1.  **Networking Foundations & Outreach Initiated:** Completed foundational networking training ("SSSS" module) and identified/applied to a local networking group ("The Breakfast Club").
2.  **Pillar 1 & 4 Partnership Identification:** Identified and initiated contact (via DMs) with several solar content creators (approx. 10K followers) as potential affiliate partners for lead generation and brand collaboration.
3.  **Pillar 2 & 3 Content Strategy Refinement:** Developed a clearer strategy for n8n content, focusing on using it as a Zapier-like microservice orchestrator, and began scripting a tutorial to demonstrate this approach.

**Key Metrics:**

*   Cold Calls Made: 0 (Focus on strategic development & networking)
*   Conversations Had: 0 (Initial DMs sent, awaiting responses)
*   Meetings Booked: 0
*   Partners Contacted: 3 (Initial DMs to solar content creators)
*   Interviews Secured: 0

**Key Learning or Roadblock:**
Realized n8n's optimal use is as a microservice orchestrator, simplifying workflow development through direct coding or CLI tools rather than complex JSON imports, which will guide future content creation.

**Main Focus for Tomorrow:**
Execute aggressive cold outreach for Pillar 1 (Enterprise Sales) based on pre-planned targets.
