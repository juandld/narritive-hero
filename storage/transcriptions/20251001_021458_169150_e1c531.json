That is a Tuesday. Today I was focusing on networking and identifying any sort of groups, and uh since I'm just starting, it's my first week implementing the four pillars. I am looking into what groups uh we can handle and I am learning about uh networking itself. So, uh good place that I started was this module uh called uh SSSS, um by uh Business Masterclass in The Real World Group. And um, uh I went through all of it and learned the basics of how to do networking. And then I started looking for places and ways to be able to get um networks. And I found, uh for example, to strengthen our first pillar, uh in the solar leads, um I found solar content creators that are basically selling to other sales people, so they uh talk about sales culture and um, they record themselves being rejected and um, trying things out, uh for, for selling to, to, to homeowners. So, uh, since they have about like a 10K following, it's still small, so we can get, I think, pretty easy deals out of them and uh, it's a win-win. So, I, I think that that would be good to start and uh, you know, reach out to them. Uh, I, I I've already sent a few DMs out to see what, what goes on there. Um, and I also, um, looked at uh ads, well, I, I looked specifically for ads that are running in my city, uh, for networking clubs, and I found one that seems like a good potential, which is The Breakfast Club. And uh, I already sent the form, well, I already um applied to enter the group, and we will see uh soon enough the results of that. Um, I also looked into uh the existing uh content that exists for um AI automation uh groups or uh communities, uh on YouTube, also within The Real World. And it seems that it, it, it is easy and there are a lot of things that can be improved. I've already thought about some content to be to make, uh the realization that I had yesterday is that N8N should be used more as a Zapier. And uh the first video idea and I'm already working on the script to make this tutorial on how we should actually be using N8N and to um make microservices that connect with N8N and how to connect them and uh set them up on a VPS and um, the workflow of developing that and and showing how it's much easier than just going through the N8N process. Or how usually um people are talking about uh making, for example, Claude or ChatGPT to make the JSON to then import to the uh N8N workflow, but um on, on the contrary, it's much easier to just use N8N as a Zapier and then use and then the work and then the the process of making the workflow would be more uh which would be easier just to code it if you know how to code. Um or you can just use a CLI tool, for example, a free one, um like the Gemini one, and uh yeah, uh go from there.", "date": "2025-10-01", "length_seconds": null, "topics": ["content", "efforts", "networking"], "tags": []}
