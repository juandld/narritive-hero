Sometimes it may feel like I'm late, but I always come through. And if it's just how you feel, I'm almost there, dancing at the edges of your timeline. My cadence doesn't match yours. How could it? You exist in measured moments, where I lose myself between the seconds, like water finding cracks in stone. You're far away, not by distance, but by perception. Why does my time have to fit yours? Does anyone truly synchronize with mine? Sometimes I'm late, but I always come through. The ideas come as droplets, deliberate, singular, precious. When I wish for a fountain's rush, perhaps I haven't practiced enough to summon the deluge. Perhaps this gentle trickle is simply how creativity manifests within me. Am I expecting too much of myself, demanding a flood when the universe designed me for a rain? You're far away, but that doesn't mean we're on different planes. It's not a hierarchy. It saddens me that you see it this way. Not above or below, it just feels distance, a space I can't immediately cross. What is it that draws me to you across this plane? Is it precisely the distance that creates this longing? When we finally converge, the journey's significance often fades from memory. Maybe I simply love the winding path rather than the destination. Maybe I find joy taking the scenic route through life. I want to find every extreme. The river of my thoughts sometimes floods beyond its banks, covering new channels through unexpected terrain. In drought, it trickles, barely enough to sustain, making me treasure each occurrence. Then without warning, the skies open, and my mind swells like a monsoon-fed current. The sediment of experience settles in the calm periods, enriching the soil where new ideas will eventually grow. Like a river that remembers its ancient path, even when diverted by human hands, my thoughts always find their way back to you. Sometimes in a rush, sometimes as a gentle approach, but always returning, always seeking that vast ocean where we can finally dissolve the boundaries between your world and mine. Maybe I want to take the longest route to the simplest destination, just overpowered, unconventional, savoring every twist and turn before reaching what others see as merely a beginning. It's just who I am, someone who exists between the expected milestones, finding meaning in spaces other rush through. And if it's just what you feel, that I've come late, then maybe it's just on my own time, a parallel existence running alongside yours, occasionally intersecting. Am I part of your life, or are you part of mine? I can't live for you, so I'll have to do mine.  Beep beep beep.
