You now have the full iteration, or at least the full context of what we're trying to do here. But, um, I seem or I see that the way to convey This is a video script, um, just to clarify. I see that the way I'm relating it is way too direct, and it seems like a documentary and it's just boring overall. I need more people to be able to digest it. So, I want to go for a more cinematic approach. So, for starters, in part one, I want to give people more of my train of thought as to how I came to this. My own search for meaning in life and, you know, how I was a 25-year-old that didn't know what to do with his life and was searching for a purpose. And looking through various spiritual and uh, um, reflective, uh, analytical philosophical approaches as to getting a meaning for life. I saw I saw a vulture. And this inspired me to go further. This inspired me to think about how the world works and Yeah, so it's going to be more of a a one-on-one. So, the first question is like, how do even if I had the solution or even have I if I had the master plan to solve everyone's problems, how would I even get the message across? How would I even get people's attention? And then go from that question to asking directly to the viewer like, "What do you think the biggest problem is? How are you affected?" Why is everybody like we killed boredom, and everything has to do with everything. It's all part of the same problem and go from there.  Beep beep beep
